## About
Machine Learning Techniques to solve the problem (insert link)
Data Preprocessing: 
Verify data types and convert them for analysis (e.g. dates to numerical format)
Remove rows with missing values (NaN) after conversion 
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Analyze numerical data using techniques like univariate linear regression
Model Building:
                              -    Prepare data for machine learning models by handling both numerical 
                                   and categorical features:
                             -     Apply general feature selection techniques
                             -     Train various models including:  
                                    a) Decision Trees
                                    b) Random Forest 
                                    c) Lasso Regression 
                                    d) XGBoost
