# SC1015 Mini Project - Optimizing Shelter Management and Boosting Adoption Rates
## About

This is the mini project for SC1015 - Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (DSAI). We performed analysis on the animal shelter  [dataset](https://data.austintexas.gov/Health-and-Community-Services/Austin-Animal-Center-Outcomes/9t4d-g238/about_data) from the open data portal of the City of Austin, Texas.

### Problem Motivation
Data-driven initiatives are vital for improving animal shelter operations, reducing overcrowding, and raising adoption rates. Shelters can use historical and real-time data to identify relevant characteristics, predict adoption results, and modify their resources and care procedures accordingly. Machine learning models provide predicted insights, helping shelters prioritize animals and improve their adoption processes. Continuous monitoring and modification to feedback guarantee that shelters can successfully adjust to changing circumstances, resulting in improved animal care and more efficient shelter management. 

### Problem Definition 
How do we optimize the management of animal shelters and increase adoption rates?
